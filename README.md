I wondered: What if I had invested at the beginning of 2023? My primary goal was to examine the relationships between these assets, considering how one might diversify a portfolio for potential risk mitigation. The Jupyter Notebook showcases an analysis of based on historical data from 2023. It investigates correlations between selected assets and portfolio performance over time.
